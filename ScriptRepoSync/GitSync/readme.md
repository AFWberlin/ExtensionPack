# Sync Git repositories to ScriptRunner

You can use the [Invoke-GitSync.ps1](./Invoke-GitSync.ps1) script to clone a Git repository to the ScriptRunner Library or pull updates to a local repository.

The script requires [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io). You can download this tool from [GitHub](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases).

## Script Parameters

- GitRepoUrl

    URL of the git repository. e.g. `https://github.com/ScriptRunner/ActionPacks.git`

## How-To create a ScriptRunner Action
